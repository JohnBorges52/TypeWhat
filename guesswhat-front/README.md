## About

- This project was created to train animations and elements by mixing Javascript with CSS and implementing FireBase as an authenticator component. Users can log in and maintain their information using email or a google account.

2. Start the game by clicking "PlayNow" and then "Start Game."
3. Wait 3 seconds as the countdown appears and start typing the wordsÂ whey appear on the screen".


## The main go was:

- create a game with a unique style.
- create a point system using react.
- create an interactive animation to lead users to the next step of the game.
- create user authentication using Firebase.

## Future Prospects

- I want to create a ranking system where the user information will be stored in a database.
- I want to create a new game mode where users can train their aim by clicking elements on the screen.
